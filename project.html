            <h2>Setting up Satellite Comms in the Army</h2>

            <!-- Project description -->
            <p> 
                During my time in the Army, a regular project I would be a part of was setting up base communications. 
                This would consist of 4 different phases: Assessment and Planning, Deployment and Installation, 
                Network Optimization and Maintenance, and Adaptation to Changing Requirements. 
            </p>

            <!-- Project phase 1 details -->
            <h3>Phase 1: Assessment and Planning</h3>
            <p>
                As a 25Q, I start by assessing the communication needs of the new base. 
                I collaborate with fellow specialists and commanders to grasp the base's size, 
                the communication types needed, and any specific security considerations. 
                This initial phase includes surveying the terrain, pinpointing potential 
                signal interference, and crafting a plan to fulfill the base's communication 
                requirements.
            </p>

            <!-- Project phase 2 details -->
            <h3>Phase 2: Deployment and Installation</h3>
            <p>
                Once the plan is in place, my role involves the deployment phase. 
                This could include setting up mobile communication units, satellite dishes, 
                and radio systems. I am responsible for installing and configuring 
                communication equipment, ensuring interoperability, and conducting tests for 
                reliable connectivity. During this phase, I might work in different teams, 
                focusing on tasks such as establishing a secure data network or configuring 
                radio systems for voice communication.
            </p>

            <!-- Project phase 3 details -->
            <h3>Phase 3: Network Optimization and Maintenance</h3>
            <p>
                After the initial setup, my ongoing responsibilities include network optimization and maintenance. 
                I monitor network performance, troubleshoot any issues, and implement improvements. 
                As a 25Q, I collaborate with cybersecurity specialists to ensure robust security protocols. 
                Additionally, I am responsible for training other military personnel on the proper use of 
                communication equipment, conducting drills, and simulating different scenarios to ensure 
                everyone is familiar with the systems in place.
            </p>

            <!-- Project phase 4 details -->
            <h3>Phase 4: Adaptation to Changing Requirements</h3>
            <p>
                In response to evolving needs, I adapt the communication infrastructure to changes in technology, 
                mission requirements, or the base's size. This might involve upgrading equipment, 
                integrating new communication technologies, and continuously assessing and enhancing the 
                network's capabilities. Throughout the project, effective communication within the team is crucial. 
                I collaborate with officers, technicians, and other specialists to ensure a seamless and 
                secure communication infrastructure that meets the military's operational needs.
